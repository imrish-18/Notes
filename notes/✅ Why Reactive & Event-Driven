✅ Why Reactive & Event-Driven?
Traditional (Servlet-based) apps use one thread per request. In high-load scenarios, this leads to thread exhaustion.

Reactive systems (e.g., using Spring WebFlux) use non-blocking I/O to serve thousands of concurrent requests using fewer threads, improving scalability and resource efficiency.

Tool/Tech	Purpose
Spring WebFlux	Reactive programming framework
Project Reactor	Reactive Streams implementation
MongoDB Reactive	Non-blocking DB interaction
Kafka / RabbitMQ	Event-driven messaging
Lombok	Boilerplate code reduction



✅ Core Concepts in Spring WebFlux
Mono<T> – A single value or empty (like Optional<T>).

Flux<T> – A stream of 0..N values (like List<T>).

Schedulers – Thread pools used for reactive execution.

Backpressure – Controlling data flow under heavy load.


✅ Project Reactor Internals and Backpressure – Deep Dive
Understanding Project Reactor (used by Spring WebFlux) and backpressure is essential for building efficient reactive and asynchronous applications.

📦 What is Project Reactor?
Project Reactor is a Reactive Streams-compliant library for building non-blocking applications on the JVM. It’s the core of Spring WebFlux.

Core Types:

Type	Description
Mono<T>	0 or 1 item
Flux<T>	0 to N items
⚙️ Reactor Internals – Simplified
1. Publisher & Subscriber
At the core is the Reactive Streams model:

Publisher: Emits data

Subscriber: Consumes data

Subscription: Manages the link (including backpressure)

Processor: Combines both Publisher and Subscriber

Reactor uses Mono and Flux as Publishers.

💥 What is Backpressure?
Backpressure is a mechanism to handle data overload—it lets the consumer control the rate of data flow from the producer.

Why it matters?
Without backpressure:

A fast producer can overwhelm a slow consumer.

This can lead to memory issues or crashes.

🔄 How Reactor Handles Backpressure
Reactor implements backpressure via the request(n) method in the Subscription.

Consumers request n items.

The source emits only n items.

If no request is made → no data is emitted.

Reactor does this behind the scenes with operators like onBackpressureBuffer() and onBackpressureDrop().

🔧 Example: Custom Backpressure Control
java
Copy
Edit
Flux<Integer> source = Flux.range(1, 1000)
    .log()
    .onBackpressureBuffer(10, i -> System.out.println("Dropped: " + i));

source
    .subscribe(
        data -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(50); // simulate slow consumer
                System.out.println("Received: " + data);
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                e.printStackTrace();
            }
        },
        err -> System.out.println("Error: " + err),
        () -> System.out.println("Done")
    );
What happens here?
The producer emits 1000 integers.

The subscriber processes slowly.

Reactor buffers up to 10 items, then starts dropping and printing the dropped ones.

🚦 Operators for Backpressure Handling

Operator	Behavior
onBackpressureBuffer()	Buffers items when overwhelmed
onBackpressureDrop()	Drops items if consumer is slow
onBackpressureLatest()	Keeps the latest item, drops others
🚀 Best Practices
Don’t block in reactive chains (Thread.sleep, JDBC, etc).

Use .limitRate(n) or .delayElements() to simulate and manage flow.

Apply Schedulers.boundedElastic() for blocking work.

Monitor with .log() or .doOnNext() during development.
