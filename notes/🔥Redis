🔥 Why Redis Cache?
Redis is widely used because of the following benefits:

✅ 1. In-Memory Speed
Redis stores data in RAM, so reads/writes are extremely fast.

Great for high-performance, low-latency access.

✅ 2. Supports Data Structures
Beyond key-value, Redis supports: Lists, Sets, Sorted Sets, Hashes, Bitmaps, HyperLogLogs, Streams, etc.

✅ 3. Distributed & Scalable
Can be clustered and sharded to handle large-scale systems.

Works well in microservices and cloud-native architectures.

✅ 4. Persistence (Optional)
You can choose to persist the data (RDB or AOF).

If your app or Redis restarts, you can recover the cache.

✅ 5. Pub/Sub and TTL Support
Built-in TTL (expiration time) and pub/sub support are handy for real-time applications and automatic invalidation.

🆚 Alternatives to Redis
Here are other caching options, and when they might be better:

Cache	Type	When to Use
Ehcache	In-process	Good for monolith apps. Java-native, simple setup, embedded in JVM.
Caffeine	In-process	Modern alternative to Guava/Ehcache, great for local in-memory caching.
Guava Cache	In-process	Simple local cache for basic use-cases, lightweight.
Hazelcast	Distributed	More feature-rich alternative to Redis. Supports distributed data & compute.
Memcached	Distributed	Very fast key-value store, simple, but no advanced data types like Redis.
Apache Ignite	Distributed	Good for high-speed processing & caching with SQL support.

🧠 When to Use Redis
Use Case	Redis Suitability
Microservices / Distributed Systems	✅
Real-time leaderboards / analytics	✅
Session storage	✅
Cache layer for DB/API	✅
Local development cache	❌ (Use Ehcache/Caffeine)


🚨 Redis Trade-offs
Memory-based ⇒ More expensive infrastructure (RAM).

External dependency ⇒ Needs a running Redis server.

Serialization cost ⇒ Might need custom serialization for complex objects.

✅ TL;DR Recommendation
🟢 Use Redis if:

You need distributed caching

You're building a microservices app

Low latency & scalability are important

🔵 Use Caffeine or Ehcache if:

You're building a monolith or don't want to manage a Redis server

Local, lightweight caching is enough
