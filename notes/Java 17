Java 17 
Java 17, released in September 2021, is a Long-Term Support (LTS) version, bringing significant improvements, new features, and performance enhancements. Here are the key features:

1. Sealed Classes (Finalized)
Sealed classes allow you to control which classes can extend or implement them.

Sealed classes were introduced as a preview feature in Java 15 and finalized in Java 17. They allow developers to restrict which classes can extend or implement a class or interface, providing better control over inheritance.
1. Why Use Sealed Classes?
ðŸ”¹ Prevents unwanted subclassing.
ðŸ”¹ Provides a clear hierarchy for better maintainability.
ðŸ”¹ Improves security and performance by limiting polymorphism.
ðŸ”¹ Helps the compiler with exhaustive pattern matching (useful for switch expressions).
5. When to Use Sealed Classes?
âœ… When you want controlled inheritance (e.g., defining a strict class hierarchy).
âœ… When designing frameworks and APIs that should limit subclassing.
âœ… When using pattern matching for better compile-time safety.

6. When NOT to Use Sealed Classes?
ðŸš« If your class is meant to be extended freely by other developers.
ðŸš« If you don't need strict control over the inheritance tree.

sealed class Vehicle permits Car, Truck {}

final class Car extends Vehicle {}
final class Truck extends Vehicle {}

 Why? Restricts unwanted subclassing and improves code safety.



 2. Pattern Matching for switch (Preview)
Enhances switch to support pattern matching.
static void printType(Object obj) {
    switch (obj) {
        case Integer i -> System.out.println("Integer: " + i);
        case String s -> System.out.println("String: " + s);
        default -> System.out.println("Other type");
    }
}

ðŸ”¹ Why? More readable and flexible switch statements.


3. Records (Finalized)
Records reduce boilerplate by auto-generating constructors, getters, toString(), equals(), and hashCode().

record Person(String name, int age) {}

Person p = new Person("Alice", 25);
System.out.println(p.name());  // No need for getters


4. New instanceof Pattern Matching
Simplifies instanceof checks.

if (obj instanceof String s) {
    System.out.println(s.toUpperCase()); // No need for explicit casting
}

ðŸ”¹ Why? Reduces redundant casting.



5. Enhanced switch Expressions
Introduces arrow syntax and yield statements.
Difference Between Old and New switch in Java
Java 12+ introduced enhanced switch expressions, making switch more powerful, concise, and useful in functional programming.
int result = switch (day) {
    case MONDAY, FRIDAY -> 6;
    case SATURDAY, SUNDAY -> 10;
    default -> 5;
};

ðŸ”¹ Why? More concise and readable switch statements.

When to Use Which?
âœ… Use new switch (expression) when:

You need a concise, value-returning switch.
You want to avoid fall-through.
You prefer functional-style programming.
âœ… Use old switch (statement) when:

You donâ€™t need to return values.
You need complex logic inside case blocks.
Why yield?
yield is required when using block cases ({}) because it explicitly returns a value.
public class YieldSwitchExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int day = 3;

        String dayType = switch (day) {
            case 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 -> "Weekday";
            case 6, 7 -> {
                System.out.println("It's a weekend!");
                yield "Weekend";  // Returns a value
            }
            default -> "Invalid day";
        };

        System.out.println(dayType);  // Output: Weekday
    }
}


6. Strongly Encapsulated JDK Internals
JDK internal APIs (like sun.misc.Unsafe) are now strongly encapsulated by default.

ðŸ”¹ Why? Improves security and maintainability.


7. New macOS AArch64 Support
Java 17 adds native support for Apple Silicon (M1/M2 chips).

ðŸ”¹ Why? Better performance on new MacBooks.

8. Deprecation and Removal of Old Features
Removed: Security Manager (was deprecated in Java 15).
Removed: RMI Activation System.
Deprecated: Finalization (will be removed in future versions).
ðŸ”¹ Why? Cleaner and more maintainable Java.



9. Foreign Function & Memory API (Preview)
Allows Java to interact with native libraries without JNI.

ðŸ”¹ Why? Faster and safer native interactions.




10. Performance & Garbage Collection Improvements
G1 GC & ZGC Enhancements â€“ Lower latency and improved performance.
Better NUMA Awareness â€“ Improved CPU and memory efficiency.
ðŸ”¹ Why? Faster execution and lower memory overhead.
