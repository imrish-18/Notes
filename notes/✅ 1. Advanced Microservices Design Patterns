✅ 1. Advanced Microservices Design Patterns
Saga Pattern (Choreography & Orchestration) – For distributed transactions.

CQRS + Event Sourcing – Separate read/write models and preserve event history.

Strangler Fig, Bulkhead, Circuit Breaker – Fault tolerance patterns.

API Gateway Patterns – Centralized security, request routing, aggregation.

Already using some of these? Learn to design and document them effectively, not just implement.

✅ 2. Reactive & Event-Driven Architectures
Deep dive into Spring WebFlux (Reactive programming)

Project Reactor internals and backpressure

Kafka, RabbitMQ, Pulsar for async/event-driven services

RSocket or gRPC for efficient inter-service comms

✅ 3. Kubernetes & Cloud-Native Deployment
Dockerize your services properly

Master Kubernetes (K8s): deployments, services, config maps, secrets

Use Helm charts for templated deployment

Learn Istio or Linkerd for service mesh

Explore AWS EKS, GCP GKE, or Azure AKS

✅ 4. Observability & Monitoring
Prometheus + Grafana for metrics

ELK / EFK stack for centralized logging

OpenTelemetry and Jaeger or Zipkin for distributed tracing

✅ 5. DevOps & CI/CD
Use GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or Jenkins for CI/CD pipelines

Learn Terraform or Pulumi for infrastructure as code (IaC)

Automate testing, building, and container deployment

✅ 6. Security
Secure services using OAuth2 / OIDC (e.g., with Keycloak)

Use Spring Security with JWT for resource protection

Handle secrets management using Vault or K8s secrets

Implement Zero Trust principles

✅ 7. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Understand Bounded Contexts, Aggregates, and Entities

Use strategic DDD to organize teams and services

Combine with microservices to reduce coupling

✅ 8. Learn a Second Programming Paradigm
Even as a Java developer, learning another language sharpens architecture skills:

Golang (lightweight microservices, cloud-native)

Rust (performance & safety)

Node.js or Python (flexibility, scripting, ML integration)

✅ Bonus: Contribution & Thought Leadership
Write blog posts or speak at meetups

Contribute to open-source projects

Mentor junior developers in your org
